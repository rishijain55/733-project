# Distributed Graph Processing with Pregel

Welcome to the distributed graph processing project based on Google's Pregel model. This repository contains multiple implementations and applications for distributed graph algorithms. This was developed as part of the course project for COL733 - Cloud Computing at IIT Delhi.

## 1. Pregel Implementation (`pregel` Folder)
Explore the core implementation of Google's Pregel model. The `pregel` folder provides the foundational framework for distributed graph processing. 

Navigate to the `apps` folder within `pregel` to find the implementation of Breadth-First Search written on top of the Pregel framework. This demonstrates the versatility of the Pregel model for graph algorithms.

## 2. Pregel with Parallel BGL (`pbgl_bfs` Folder)
Discover the integration of Pregel with the Parallel BGL (Boost Graph Library) in the `pbgl_bfs` folder. This showcases the combination of Pregel's model with the powerful capabilities of Parallel BGL.

## 3. Parallel BFS using Open MPI (`custom_bfs` Folder)
Inside the `custom_bfs` folder, find the implementation of parallel Breadth-First Search using Open MPI. This demonstrates the adaptability of the project to different parallel computing environments.

## Additional Information
For detailed instructions, configurations, and insights into the project, please refer to the `report.pdf` file. It provides comprehensive documentation, including setup instructions, execution guidelines, and further details about each component.

Feel free to explore and leverage the different implementations for your graph processing needs. If you have any questions or need assistance, please refer to the documentation or reach out for support.

Happy exploring! ðŸš€
